- Research Object Reviewed (ROR), Reusable
*Motivation*
The artifact is reusable: (i) it allows exactly replicating the results obtained in the paper; (ii) it allows using the same input parameters presented in the paper to generate new results and evaluate how they are affected by stochasticity; (iii) it allows users to change input parameters and study the same design pattern for different scenarios.
